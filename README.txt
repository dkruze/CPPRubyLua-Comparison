These three files written in Ruby, Lua, and C++ all perform the exact same function, but are written very differently.
This is done to showcase the great differences between their syntaxes, and I have included a powerpoint with pictures and lists of comparisons to aid comprehensions.
Any of these source files can be run from compatible systems, but they are designed using and intended for Replit.com.
To run these scripts yourself, you need to make separate Repls for each language and include the respective source files as Main.[extension] in its own Repl.
This will allow you to see their identical output more clearly than the pictures in the powerpoint.
